Addressing crime patterns and hotspots in Kansas City is crucial for enhancing public safety, informing policy making, and increasing community awareness. By understanding where and when crimes occur, law enforcement can allocate resources more effectively and develop targeted crime prevention strategies. This insight also aids policymakers in creating tailored policies to address specific community issues. Additionally, sharing this information with the public boosts awareness and encourages community participation in safety initiatives, contributing to a safer and more informed community overall.

I want to achieve a thorough understanding of crime dynamics in Kansas City through various visualization tasks, identifying trends, and correlating them with socio-demographic and pandemic data. Enable law enforcement and city officials to make data-driven decisions in addressing crime-related issues. In order to accomplish the above objectives, I’m going to create a dashboard with appropriate visualizations showing the comparisons among the crime descriptions. Basically highlighting the impact of covid on the crime rate visually.

Law Enforcement Agencies will benefit from data-driven insights for effective deployment of resources and formulation of crime prevention strategies. Public and Community Groups can gain a better understanding of crime patterns and risks, empowering them to participate in community safety efforts and make informed decisions about personal safety. Researchers and Academics can utilize the analysis for further studies on crime trends and their correlations with socio-economic factors and public health crises like COVID-19.

I would like to join the datasets using linking attributes listed above so that I can check how Covid has impacted the crime rate in Kansas City. For example, after joining 2018 & 2020 Kansas City crime datasets, I can see whether the crime rate has fallen in a selected zip code based on looking at the “Zip code”, count of “Description” attributes, I can see which quarter/month has recorded higher number of cases based on “Zip code”, “Month” & count of “Description” attributes, I can see which types of offenses committed have been increased/ decreased before and after covid using the “Description” “year” attributes. I can see the Victim demographics. The covid by zip code and crime datasets can be combined using zip code attribute and I can check whether the increased number of cases in a certain zip code affected the number of crimes committed in the year 2020 using the “zip code”, ”Cases”, “Crude Rate per 100,000”’

Visualization is needed to solve the problem of identifying crime hotspots, understanding seasonal crime trends, and assessing the impact of COVID-19 on crime rates in Kansas City, Missouri. I think the data tables and/or manual/automated methods are insufficient to solve the problem because of the below points.
They are not effective for identifying patterns and trends in large datasets and it is very difficult to interpret.
Visualization can help to communicate complex information in a clear and concise way.
Visualization can help to generate new insights and ideas.
Even though automated methods are the best at processing large amounts of datasets, visualization helps the reader to comprehend the data in a better way. For example, with the help of automated methods, I can detect the outliers, trends/patterns but with the help of visualization I can understand the context behind the outliers, how the trends change over time/ detect the subtle,underlying patterns rather than the statistical patterns derived from the automated methods. To be precise, let's say the automated methods show us that there is an increased crime report in a particular year, but with visualizations I can create a time-series where I can see the quarterly or monthly comparison of the crimes. These visualizations might reveal that there is a significant rise in crime in summer months compared to winter. I can draw such feedback with the help of visualizations and human interaction. 
 
Visualization Tasks :
Detect :
Detect the hotspot regions of Kansas city with more crimes.
Detect the long-term trends in crime data over several years


Compare :
Compare the different quarters of the year with the Crime count to identify which quarter has the most number of crimes.
Compare how crime rates relate to demographic variables like race, gender, and age.

Identify the areas of Kansas city that are most affected by Crime.
Identifying the locations within Kansas City are most susceptible to which types of crimes.
